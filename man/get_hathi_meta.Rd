\title{Reads the metadata of a single downloaded Hathi Trust extracted features file}
\usage{
get_hathi_meta(htid, dir = getOption("hathiTools.ef.dir"))
}
\arguments{
\item{htid}{The Hathi Trust id of the item whose extracted features files are
to be downloaded.}

\item{dir}{The directory where the file is saved. Defaults to
\code{getOption("hathiTools.ef.dir")}, which is just "./hathi-ef/ on load. If
the file does not exist, this function will first attempt to download it
using \link{download_hathi_ef}.}
}
\value{
a \link{tibble} with metadata.
}
\description{
Note that if you want to extract the metadata of more than one Hathi Trust ID
at a time, it is best to simply query the Workset Builder database using
\link{get_workset_meta}. Using \link{get_workset_meta} also guarantees you'll get a
rectangular data with HT ids in the rows. It is also possible to get simple
metadata for large numbers of htids by downloading the big hathifile using
\link{download_hathifile} and then filtering it.
